    "# RAG Retrieval Enhanced with Document Summaries\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We load the original document chunks.\n",
    "2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using OpenAI (or an OpenAI compatible API).\n",
    "3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries."

    "In this section, we implement the retrieval process using our new summary-enhanced vector database. This approach leverages the enhanced embeddings we created, which incorporate document summaries along with the original content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of this updated retrieval process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We search the vector database using the query embedding, retrieving the top k most similar documents.\n",
    "2. For each retrieved document, we include the chunk heading, summary, and full text in the context provided to the LLM.\n",
    "3. This enriched context is then used to generate an answer to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By including summaries in both the embedding and retrieval phases, we aim to provide the LLM with a more comprehensive and focused context. This could potentially lead to more accurate and relevant answers, as the LLM has access to both a concise overview (the summary) and the detailed information (the full text) for each relevant document chunk."

      "You can use an LLM like Claude to grade the outputs of other LLMs by providing it with the output to grade along with a detailed rubric. Instruct the LLM to think through its reasoning and then output a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect' result based on how well the output matches the criteria in the rubric.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "To use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Develop a Clear Rubric**: Create a detailed and clear rubric that outlines the criteria for grading. For example, specify that certain key phrases must be included in the response, or define a scoring scale (e.g., 1-5) for qualitative assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Construct Grading Prompts**: Use a function to build a prompt for Claude that includes the answer to be graded and the rubric. The prompt should instruct Claude to think through its reasoning before providing a final grade. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def build_grader_prompt(answer, rubric):\n",
      "       return f\"\"\"Grade this answer based on the rubric:\n",
      "       <rubric>{rubric}</rubric>\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implement Grading Logic**: Create a function that sends the constructed prompt to Claude and retrieves the grading response. This function should check if the response indicates 'correct' or 'incorrect':\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def grade_completion(output, golden_answer):\n",
      "       grader_response = client.messages.create(\n",

      "       return \"correct\" if \"correct\" in grader_response.lower() else \"incorrect\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evaluate Outputs**: Gather the outputs from the LLMs you want to grade and compare them against the expected answers (golden answers). Use the grading function to evaluate each output:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   eval_data = [\n",
      "       {\"question\": \"Is 42 the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\", \"golden_answer\": \"Yes, according to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.\"},\n",

      "   grades = [grade_completion(output, a[\"golden_answer\"]) for output, a in zip(outputs, eval_data)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculate Scores**: Finally, calculate the overall score based on the grading results to assess the performance of the LLMs being evaluated:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   print(f\"Score: {grades.count('correct') / len(grades) * 100}%\")\n",

      "__Correct answer__:\n",
      "Providing edge case examples to Claude in the prompt can meaningfully improve its performance in correctly routing support tickets in scenarios where it may otherwise misclassify them, such as implicit requests, emotional prioritization, ambiguous intent vs. routing, or issue prioritization.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "Providing Claude with examples of handling edge cases like implicit requests and emotional prioritization can significantly enhance its performance in routing support tickets. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implicit Requests**: Customers often communicate their needs indirectly. For instance, a statement like “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now” implies a request for order status. By training Claude with examples of such implicit requests, it can learn to recognize and appropriately classify these indirect inquiries, ensuring that tickets are routed to the right team without requiring explicit requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotional Prioritization**: Customers may express dissatisfaction or frustration, which can be crucial for prioritizing their tickets. If Claude is equipped with guidelines on when to prioritize emotional sentiment over the technical aspects of a problem, it can better address urgent customer concerns. This means that tickets from dissatisfied customers could be escalated or routed more quickly to ensure timely resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intent vs. Routing**: There are instances where Claude might correctly identify a customer's intent but misroute the ticket. By providing examples that clarify the appropriate routing for various intents, Claude can improve its accuracy in directing tickets to the correct departments, reducing misclassifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Issue Prioritization**: When customers present multiple issues in a single interaction, it can be challenging for Claude to determine which issue to prioritize. By clarifying how to identify and prioritize the primary concern among multiple issues, Claude can enhance its ability to route tickets effectively, ensuring that the most pressing matters are addressed first.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, incorporating these edge case examples into Claude's training can lead to more accurate classifications and improved routing of support tickets, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

      "The size of the context window significantly impacts a language model's ability to utilize retrieval augmented generation (RAG). A larger context window allows the model to incorporate more retrieved information from the external knowledge base along with the original query, enabling it to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses. This is particularly important in RAG, where the model needs to reference both the input prompt and the retrieved data to produce coherent and informed outputs.\n",

The final version available through the API, such as Claude 3.5 Sonnet, has undergone additional fine-tuning and optimization to enhance its performance, making it more intelligent and capable of handling specific tasks effectively.\n",

This version is tailored for better performance and may include improvements based on user feedback and ongoing research.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Access and Usage**: The pretrained model may not be directly accessible for application development, whereas the final version is available through the Anthropic API, allowing developers to integrate it into their applications with specific functionalities and parameters.\n",
