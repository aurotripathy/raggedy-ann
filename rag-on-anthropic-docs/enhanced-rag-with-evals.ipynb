    "# RAG Retrieval Enhanced with Document Summaries\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We load the original document chunks.\n",
    "2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using OpenAI (or an OpenAI compatible API).\n",
    "3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries."

Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency : Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining. Comprehension improvements : Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents Preserves general knowledge : Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model’s broad capabilities. Transparency : Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives.

      "Ticket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket’s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer’s issue are available for analysis and classification.\n",
      "Support Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\n",
      "Ticket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\n",
      "Note: While the classification method calls Claude API, we’ve removed that extra call from the diagram for simplicity.\n",

      "The document describes two approaches for integrating the Claude AI model into a support workflow: a push-based approach using webhooks, where the support ticket system triggers the classification process, and a pull-based approach where the code periodically checks for new tickets. The push-based approach is more scalable but requires exposing a public endpoint, while the pull-based approach is easier to implement but may result in unnecessary calls to the support ticket system.\n",

Please try again later.” Max tokens exceeded If Claude’s response is cut off due to hitting the max_tokens limit, and the truncated response contains an incomplete tool use block, you’ll need to retry the request with a higher max_tokens value to get the full tool use. Invalid tool name If Claude’s attempted use of a tool is invalid (e.g. missing required parameters), it usually means that the there wasn’t enough information for Claude to use the tool correctly. Your best bet during development is to try the request again with more-detailed description values in your tool definitions. However, you can also continue the conversation forward with a tool_result that indicates the error, and Claude will try to use the tool again with the missing information filled in: JSON { \"role\" : \"user\" , \"content\" : [ { \"type\" : \"tool_result\" , \"tool_use_id\" : \"toolu_01A09q90qw90lq917835lq9\" , \"content\" : \"Error: Missing required 'location' parameter\" , \"is_error\" : true } ] } If a tool request is invalid or missing parameters, Claude will retry 2-3 times with corrections before apologizing to the user. <search_quality_reflection> tags To prevent Claude from reflecting on search quality with <search_quality_reflection> tags, add “Do not reflect on the quality of the returned search results in your response” to your prompt.\n",

      "When integrating your code into production, you’ll need to architect how it fits into the flow of your ticket routing system. There are two ways you could go around doing this:\n",
      "Push-based: Where the Support Ticket System you’re using (e.g. Zendesk an Anthropic partner) will trigger your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service, which will then classify the intent and route it.\n",
      "Pull-Based: Where your code could pull for the latest tickets at a certain schedule and then route them.\n",
      "While the bulk of the classification work discussed in previous sections remains the same, you will need to wrap your code in a service for either of the two approaches above. The choice of approach depends on what APIs the support ticketing system provides. Between the two, the push-based approach using webhooks is more web-scaleable but needs you to expose a public endpoint that might have IT Security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram above shows the push-based approach in action:\n",
      "Support Ticket Creation - The process begins when a customer creates a new support ticket. The customer provides the necessary information about their issue or inquiry, which is then submitted to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "Webhook Event Generation - Upon receiving the new support ticket, the Support Ticket System should generate a Webhook Event Ticket Created notification. This event triggers the subsequent steps in the ticket routing process.\n",
      "Ticket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket’s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer’s issue are available for analysis and classification.\n",
      "Support Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\n",
      "Ticket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\n",

      "Implicit Requests: Customers often express needs indirectly. For example, “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now.” is an indirect request for order status.\n",
      "Emotional Prioritization: When customers express dissatisfaction, Claude may prioritize addressing the emotion over solving the underlying problem. Providing Claude with directions on when to prioritize customer sentiment or not can be helpful.\n",
      "Intent vs. Routing: Claude may correctly identify a customer intent, but route it incorrectly. Clarifying the appropriate routes of certain intents is important, especially when the routes may be more ambiguous.\n",
      "Issue Prioritization: When customers present multiple issues in a single interaction, Claude may have difficulty identifying the primary concern. Clarifying the prioritization of intents can help Claude better identify the primary concern.\n",

Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency : Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining. Comprehension improvements : Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents Preserves general knowledge : Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge.

      "What image file types does Claude support? Claude currently supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP image formats, specifically: image/jpeg image/png image/gif image/webp Can Claude read image URLs? No, Claude cannot read image URLs on any interface, including on claude.ai. Our API does not currently support adding URLs in either the text or image blocks. Adding image URLs (or URLs of any sort) in the text block might cause Claude to hallucinate, as Claude is currently unable to retrieve information from that URL. Is there a limit to the image file size I can upload? Yes, there are limits: API: Maximum 5MB per image claude.ai: Maximum 10MB per image Images larger than these limits will be rejected and return an error when using our API. How many images can I include in one request? The image limits are: Messages API: Up to 20 images per request claude.ai: Up to 5 images per turn Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error. Does Claude read image metadata? No, Claude does not parse or receive any metadata from images passed to it. Can I delete images I've uploaded? No. Image uploads are ephemeral and not stored beyond the duration of the API request. Uploaded images are automatically deleted after they have been processed. Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads? Please refer to our privacy policy page for information on how we handle uploaded images and other data. We do not use uploaded images to train our models. What if Claude's image interpretation seems wrong? If Claude’s image interpretation seems incorrect: Ensure the image is clear, high-quality, and correctly oriented. Try prompt engineering techniques to improve results. If the issue persists, flag the output in claude.ai (thumbs up/down) or contact our support team. Your feedback helps us improve! Can Claude generate or edit images? No, Claude is an image understanding model only. It can interpret and analyze images, but it cannot generate, produce, edit, manipulate, or create images.\n",

      "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language model generation to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated text, and to better ground the model’s response in evidence. In RAG, a language model is augmented with an external knowledge base or a set of documents that is passed into the context window. The data is retrieved at run time when a query is sent to the model, although the model itself does not necessarily retrieve the data (but can with tool use and a retrieval function). When generating text, relevant information first must be retrieved from the knowledge base based on the input prompt, and then passed to the model along with the original query. The model uses this information to guide the output it generates. This allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, reducing the reliance on memorization and improving the factual accuracy of the generated text. RAG can be particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or explicit citation of sources. However, the effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the external knowledge base and the knowledge that is retrieved at runtime.\n",

      "When integrating your code into production, you’ll need to architect how it fits into the flow of your ticket routing system. There are two ways you could go around doing this:\n",
      "Push-based: Where the Support Ticket System you’re using (e.g. Zendesk an Anthropic partner) will trigger your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service, which will then classify the intent and route it.\n",
      "Pull-Based: Where your code could pull for the latest tickets at a certain schedule and then route them.\n",
      "While the bulk of the classification work discussed in previous sections remains the same, you will need to wrap your code in a service for either of the two approaches above. The choice of approach depends on what APIs the support ticketing system provides. Between the two, the push-based approach using webhooks is more web-scaleable but needs you to expose a public endpoint that might have IT Security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram above shows the push-based approach in action:\n",
      "Support Ticket Creation - The process begins when a customer creates a new support ticket. The customer provides the necessary information about their issue or inquiry, which is then submitted to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "Webhook Event Generation - Upon receiving the new support ticket, the Support Ticket System should generate a Webhook Event Ticket Created notification. This event triggers the subsequent steps in the ticket routing process.\n",
      "Ticket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket’s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer’s issue are available for analysis and classification.\n",
      "Support Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\n",
      "Ticket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\n",
      "Note: While the classification method calls Claude API, we’ve removed that extra call from the diagram for simplicity.\n",

      "The document describes two approaches for integrating the Claude AI model into a support workflow: a push-based approach using webhooks, where the support ticket system triggers the classification process, and a pull-based approach where the code periodically checks for new tickets. The push-based approach is more scalable but requires exposing a public endpoint, while the pull-based approach is easier to implement but may result in unnecessary calls to the support ticket system.\n",

      "To assess your classifier’s performance, we’ll call our classifier function and compare the predicted intent with the actual intent. To maintain the integrity of our evaluation, first remove the tickets used as examples in the prompt. Accuracy will be calculated as the percentage of correct predictions.\n",
      "While more sophisticated metrics like F1-score offer a better measurement of the model’s performance, we’ll keep things simple for this evaluation. We’ll also focus on the predicted intent and ignore the returned reasoning for now though the reasoning will help you better understand the results.\n",

      "Prompting vs. finetuning Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency : Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining. Comprehension improvements : Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents Preserves general knowledge : Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model’s broad capabilities. Transparency : Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.\n",

      "You can upload PDFs and have Claude summarize their content, making it easier to understand the key points of long documents without having to read through everything.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "To use Claude for digesting long PDF documents more easily, follow these strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Place Longform Data at the Top**: Start your prompt with the content of the PDF document. This helps Claude understand the context better. For documents that are around 20,000 tokens or more, ensure this data is positioned at the top of your prompt, above any queries or instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Structure Content with XML Tags**: If you are working with multiple documents, use XML tags to organize the content clearly. For example, wrap each document in `<document>` tags, and include `<document_content>` and `<source>` tags for clarity. This structured approach helps Claude process the information more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example structure:\n",
      "   ```xml\n",
      "   <documents>\n",
      "     <document index=\"1\">\n",
      "       <source>your_document.pdf</source>\n",

      "     </document>\n",
      "   </documents>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ground Responses in Quotes**: Ask Claude to extract and quote relevant parts of the document before proceeding with any analysis or summarization. This helps focus on the most pertinent information and reduces the noise from the rest of the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example prompt:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Find quotes from the document that summarize the key points. Then, based on these quotes, provide a concise summary of the document's main ideas.\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Place Queries at the End**: After providing the longform data and context, place your specific questions or requests at the end of the prompt. This can improve the quality of Claude's responses by allowing it to first process the context before addressing your queries.\n",

      "The Messages API handles mid-response prompting by allowing the last input message to have the assistant role, which enables the response to continue from that point. This means you can pre-fill part of the assistant's response by including it in the last message. For example, if you set the last message as an assistant message, the model will continue generating text from where that message leaves off.\n",

      "Overall, while both APIs allow for mid-response prompting, the Messages API uses a structured format with roles (user and assistant) and a list of messages, whereas the Text Completions API relies on a simpler raw string format.

      "How can you use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric?\n",
      "__Correct answer__:\n",
      "You can use an LLM like Claude to grade the outputs of other LLMs by providing it with the output to grade along with a detailed rubric. Instruct the LLM to think through its reasoning and then output a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect' result based on how well the output matches the criteria in the rubric.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "To use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Develop a Clear Rubric**: Create detailed and specific grading criteria. For example, specify that certain key phrases must be included in the answer, or define a scoring scale (e.g., 1-5) for qualitative assessments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Construct Grader Prompts**: Use a function to build prompts that instruct Claude to evaluate the answer based on the rubric. The prompt should include the rubric and the answer to be graded, and it should encourage Claude to reason through its evaluation before providing a final judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example of a prompt structure:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def build_grader_prompt(answer, rubric):\n",
      "       return f\"\"\"Grade this answer based on the rubric:\n",
      "       <rubric>{rubric}</rubric>\n",
      "       <answer>{answer}</answer>\n",
      "       Think through your reasoning in <thinking> tags, then output 'correct' or 'incorrect' in <result> tags.\"\"\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implement Grading Functionality**: Create a function that sends the constructed prompt to Claude and retrieves the grading result. This function should interpret Claude's response to determine if the answer is \"correct\" or \"incorrect\".\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example grading function:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def grade_completion(output, golden_answer):\n",
      "       grader_response = client.messages.create(\n",
      "           model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n",
      "           max_tokens=2048,\n",

      "\n",
      "       return \"correct\" if \"correct\" in grader_response.lower() else \"incorrect\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evaluate Outputs**: Collect the outputs from the LLMs you want to grade, and for each output, use the grading function to assess it against the rubric. \n",
      "\n",
      "   Example usage:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   outputs = [get_completion(q[\"question\"]) for q in eval_data]\n",
      "   grades = [grade_completion(output, a[\"golden_answer\"]) for output, a in zip(outputs, eval_data)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculate and Report Scores**: After grading, calculate the percentage of correct answers to evaluate overall performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example score calculation:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   print(f\"Score: {grades.count('correct') / len(grades) * 100}%\")\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can effectively leverage Claude to automate the grading of outputs from other LLMs based on a predefined rubric.\n",

      "Prompting vs. finetuning Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency : Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining. Comprehension improvements : Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents Preserves general knowledge : Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model’s broad capabilities. Transparency : Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives.

      "Resource efficiency: Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly.\n",
      "Cost-effectiveness: For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper.\n",
      "Maintaining model updates: When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes.\n",
      "Time-saving: Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving.\n",
      "Minimal data needs: Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning.\n",
      "Flexibility & rapid iteration: Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning.\n",
      "Domain adaptation: Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.\n",
      "Comprehension improvements: Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents\n",
      "Preserves general knowledge: Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge. Prompt engineering maintains the model’s broad capabilities.\n",
      "Transparency: Prompts are human-readable, showing exactly what information the model receives. This transparency aids in understanding and debugging.\n",

      "When integrating your code into production, you’ll need to architect how it fits into the flow of your ticket routing system. There are two ways you could go around doing this:\n",
      "Push-based: Where the Support Ticket System you’re using (e.g. Zendesk an Anthropic partner) will trigger your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service, which will then classify the intent and route it.\n",
      "Pull-Based: Where your code could pull for the latest tickets at a certain schedule and then route them.\n",
      "While the bulk of the classification work discussed in previous sections remains the same, you will need to wrap your code in a service for either of the two approaches above. The choice of approach depends on what APIs the support ticketing system provides. Between the two, the push-based approach using webhooks is more web-scaleable but needs you to expose a public endpoint that might have IT Security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram above shows the push-based approach in action:\n",
      "Support Ticket Creation - The process begins when a customer creates a new support ticket. The customer provides the necessary information about their issue or inquiry, which is then submitted to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "Webhook Event Generation - Upon receiving the new support ticket, the Support Ticket System should generate a Webhook Event Ticket Created notification. This event triggers the subsequent steps in the ticket routing process.\n",
      "Ticket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket’s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer’s issue are available for analysis and classification.\n",
      "Support Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\n",
      "Ticket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\n",
      "Note: While the classification method calls Claude API, we’ve removed that extra call from the diagram for simplicity.\n",

      "1. **Implicit Requests**: Customers often communicate their needs indirectly. For instance, a statement like “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now” implies a request for order status. By training Claude with examples of such implicit requests, it can learn to recognize and interpret these indirect cues, ensuring that tickets are routed to the appropriate team without requiring explicit requests from customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotional Prioritization**: Customers frequently express emotions such as frustration or dissatisfaction. If Claude is equipped with guidelines on when to prioritize emotional responses over technical solutions, it can better address customer sentiment. This means that in cases where a customer is upset, Claude can route the ticket to a team that specializes in customer care or escalation, rather than just focusing on the technical issue at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intent vs. Routing**: Claude may accurately identify a customer's intent but misroute the ticket. By clarifying the appropriate routes for certain intents through examples, Claude can improve its routing accuracy, ensuring that tickets reach the right department based on the specific context of the inquiry.\n",

      "Breaking a task into distinct subtasks for chained prompts improves Claude's accuracy because each subtask gets Claude's full attention, reducing errors compared to tackling the entire complex task at once.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "Breaking a task into distinct subtasks for chained prompts helps improve Claude's accuracy on the overall task for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Focused Attention**: Each subtask allows Claude to concentrate fully on a specific aspect of the task, which reduces the likelihood of errors. When tasks are complex, dividing them into simpler components helps ensure that each part is addressed thoroughly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Clarity**: Simpler subtasks lead to clearer instructions and outputs. This clarity helps both the model and the user understand what is expected at each stage, minimizing confusion and misinterpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Traceability**: By breaking down tasks, it becomes easier to trace the workflow and identify where issues may arise. If a problem occurs, it can be pinpointed to a specific subtask, making debugging more straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Structured Thinking**: Allowing Claude to think through each subtask in a structured manner leads to more coherent and organized responses. This structured approach is particularly beneficial for complex tasks that require logical reasoning or analysis.\n",

      "5. **Reduced Hallucinations**: Chaining prompts and specifying desired output formats can help mitigate inconsistencies and hallucinations in responses, leading to more reliable outputs.\n",

      "When integrating your code into production, you’ll need to architect how it fits into the flow of your ticket routing system. There are two ways you could go around doing this:\n",
      "Push-based: Where the Support Ticket System you’re using (e.g. Zendesk an Anthropic partner) will trigger your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service, which will then classify the intent and route it.\n",
      "Pull-Based: Where your code could pull for the latest tickets at a certain schedule and then route them.\n",
      "While the bulk of the classification work discussed in previous sections remains the same, you will need to wrap your code in a service for either of the two approaches above. The choice of approach depends on what APIs the support ticketing system provides. Between the two, the push-based approach using webhooks is more web-scaleable but needs you to expose a public endpoint that might have IT Security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram above shows the push-based approach in action:\n",
      "Support Ticket Creation - The process begins when a customer creates a new support ticket. The customer provides the necessary information about their issue or inquiry, which is then submitted to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "Webhook Event Generation - Upon receiving the new support ticket, the Support Ticket System should generate a Webhook Event Ticket Created notification. This event triggers the subsequent steps in the ticket routing process.\n",
      "Ticket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket’s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer’s issue are available for analysis and classification.\n",
      "Support Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\n",
      "Ticket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\n",

      "Implicit Requests: Customers often express needs indirectly. For example, “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now.” is an indirect request for order status.\n",
      "Emotional Prioritization: When customers express dissatisfaction, Claude may prioritize addressing the emotion over solving the underlying problem. Providing Claude with directions on when to prioritize customer sentiment or not can be helpful.\n",
      "Intent vs. Routing: Claude may correctly identify a customer intent, but route it incorrectly. Clarifying the appropriate routes of certain intents is important, especially when the routes may be more ambiguous.\n",
      "Issue Prioritization: When customers present multiple issues in a single interaction, Claude may have difficulty identifying the primary concern. Clarifying the prioritization of intents can help Claude better identify the primary concern.\n",

      "What image file types does Claude support? Claude currently supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and WebP image formats, specifically: image/jpeg image/png image/gif image/webp Can Claude read image URLs? No, Claude cannot read image URLs on any interface, including on claude.ai. Our API does not currently support adding URLs in either the text or image blocks. Adding image URLs (or URLs of any sort) in the text block might cause Claude to hallucinate, as Claude is currently unable to retrieve information from that URL. Is there a limit to the image file size I can upload? Yes, there are limits: API: Maximum 5MB per image claude.ai: Maximum 10MB per image Images larger than these limits will be rejected and return an error when using our API. How many images can I include in one request? The image limits are: Messages API: Up to 20 images per request claude.ai: Up to 5 images per turn Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error. Does Claude read image metadata? No, Claude does not parse or receive any metadata from images passed to it. Can I delete images I've uploaded? No. Image uploads are ephemeral and not stored beyond the duration of the API request. Uploaded images are automatically deleted after they have been processed. Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads? Please refer to our privacy policy page for information on how we handle uploaded images and other data. We do not use uploaded images to train our models. What if Claude's image interpretation seems wrong? If Claude’s image interpretation seems incorrect: Ensure the image is clear, high-quality, and correctly oriented. Try prompt engineering techniques to improve results. If the issue persists, flag the output in claude.ai (thumbs up/down) or contact our support team. Your feedback helps us improve! Can Claude generate or edit images? No, Claude is an image understanding model only. It can interpret and analyze images, but it cannot generate, produce, edit, manipulate, or create images.\n",

Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining. Comprehension improvements : Prompt engineering is far more effective than finetuning at helping models better understand and utilize external content such as retrieved documents Preserves general knowledge : Fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting, where the model loses general knowledge.

      "1. **Text Content Blocks**:\n",
      "   - The delta format for text content blocks is straightforward and focuses on text changes. It uses a `text_delta` type to represent updates to the text. \n",

No, Claude cannot read image URLs on any interface, including on claude.ai. Our API does not currently support adding URLs in either the text or image blocks. Adding image URLs (or URLs of any sort) in the text block might cause Claude to hallucinate, as Claude is currently unable to retrieve information from that URL. Is there a limit to the image file size I can upload? Yes, there are limits: API: Maximum 5MB per image claude.ai: Maximum 10MB per image Images larger than these limits will be rejected and return an error when using our API. How many images can I include in one request? The image limits are: Messages API: Up to 20 images per request claude.ai: Up to 5 images per turn Requests exceeding these limits will be rejected and return an error. Does Claude read image metadata? No, Claude does not parse or receive any metadata from images passed to it. Can I delete images I've uploaded? No. Image uploads are ephemeral and not stored beyond the duration of the API request. Uploaded images are automatically deleted after they have been processed. Where can I find details on data privacy for image uploads? Please refer to our privacy policy page for information on how we handle uploaded images and other data.

      "When selecting a Claude model for an enterprise use case that requires low latency, it's important to choose the model that best balances speed and output quality based on the specific requirements of the use case.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "One key consideration when selecting a Claude model for an enterprise use case that needs low latency is to balance the model's intelligence with its speed. Choosing a model from the Claude 3 or Claude 3.5 families that prioritizes speed can help meet low latency requirements while still addressing the complex needs of the enterprise. Additionally, implementing strategies such as optimizing network connections and using asynchronous API calls can further reduce latency.\n",

      "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language model generation to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated text, and to better ground the model’s response in evidence. In RAG, a language model is augmented with an external knowledge base or a set of documents that is passed into the context window. The data is retrieved at run time when a query is sent to the model, although the model itself does not necessarily retrieve the data (but can with tool use and a retrieval function). When generating text, relevant information first must be retrieved from the knowledge base based on the input prompt, and then passed to the model along with the original query. The model uses this information to guide the output it generates. This allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, reducing the reliance on memorization and improving the factual accuracy of the generated text. RAG can be particularly useful for tasks that require up-to-date information, domain-specific knowledge, or explicit citation of sources. However, the effectiveness of RAG depends on the quality and relevance of the external knowledge base and the knowledge that is retrieved at runtime.\n",

      "The size of the context window significantly impacts a language model's ability to utilize retrieval augmented generation (RAG). A larger context window allows the model to incorporate more retrieved information from the external knowledge base along with the original query, enabling it to generate more accurate and contextually relevant responses.

      "__Correct answer__:\n",
      "Providing Claude with a specific role, such as being the General Counsel of a company, using XML tags can help it catch critical legal issues and risks in a contract that it might miss without the role context, potentially saving the company millions of dollars.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "Using XML tags to provide a specific role or context can significantly enhance Claude's analysis of a legal contract in several ways compared to not using a role prompt. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Clarity and Structure**: XML tags help clearly separate different parts of the prompt, ensuring that Claude understands the context and specific requirements of the task. This structured approach reduces ambiguity and helps Claude focus on the relevant aspects of the contract analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Enhanced Accuracy**: By defining a specific role, such as \"General Counsel of a Fortune 500 tech company,\" Claude can tailor its analysis to the expectations and expertise associated with that role. This leads to a more accurate identification of critical issues, as seen in the example where the AI highlights significant risks related to indemnification, liability, and IP ownership that a general counsel would prioritize.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Improved Focus**: Role prompting keeps Claude aligned with the specific requirements of the task. When the role is clearly defined, Claude is more likely to concentrate on the most pertinent details and provide a thorough analysis that addresses potential risks, rather than offering a generic summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Critical Issue Identification**: Without a role prompt, Claude may overlook critical issues that could have substantial financial implications. The example demonstrates that when prompted with a specific role, Claude not only identifies these issues but also provides actionable recommendations, such as rejecting unfavorable terms.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Post-Processing Ease**: Using XML tags allows for easier extraction of specific parts of the response. This is particularly useful in legal contexts where precise information needs to be reviewed or presented separately, enhancing the overall utility of the analysis.\n",

      "Implement retry logic: While Claude is a robust and highly available assistant, it’s crucial to add try/except logic to handle cases where Claude doesn’t return the expected formatted output or is temporarily unavailable. Implement back-off logic to retry after increasing intervals or slightly adjust the temperature to generate output variations.\n",
      "Thorough staging testing: Conduct extensive testing in a staging environment that closely resembles your production setup. This will help identify any potential issues or incompatibilities before deployment.\n",

      "Error handling and logging: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms to facilitate debugging and monitoring in production. This will help you quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.\n",
      "Gradual rollout: Establish a phased rollout plan, starting with a small percentage of traffic and gradually increasing it while closely monitoring the system’s behavior. This approach minimizes risk and allows for a controlled deployment.\n",
      "Documentation and training: Prepare detailed documentation and provide training to relevant stakeholders on how to use and maintain the new system effectively. This ensures a smooth transition and promotes adoption.\n",
      "Monitoring and alerting: Set up robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively detect and address any issues that may arise in production. This enables your team to respond quickly and minimize downtime.\n",

      "When integrating your code into production, you’ll need to architect how it fits into the flow of your ticket routing system. There are two ways you could go around doing this:\n",
      "Push-based: Where the Support Ticket System you’re using (e.g. Zendesk an Anthropic partner) will trigger your code by sending a webhook event to your routing service, which will then classify the intent and route it.\n",
      "Pull-Based: Where your code could pull for the latest tickets at a certain schedule and then route them.\n",
      "While the bulk of the classification work discussed in previous sections remains the same, you will need to wrap your code in a service for either of the two approaches above. The choice of approach depends on what APIs the support ticketing system provides. Between the two, the push-based approach using webhooks is more web-scaleable but needs you to expose a public endpoint that might have IT Security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagram above shows the push-based approach in action:\n",
      "Support Ticket Creation - The process begins when a customer creates a new support ticket. The customer provides the necessary information about their issue or inquiry, which is then submitted to the Support Ticket System.\n",
      "Webhook Event Generation - Upon receiving the new support ticket, the Support Ticket System should generate a Webhook Event Ticket Created notification. This event triggers the subsequent steps in the ticket routing process.\n",
      "Ticket Content Retrieval - The webhook event initiates the retrieval of the ticket’s contents from the Support Ticket System. This step ensures that the full details of the customer’s issue are available for analysis and classification.\n",
      "Support Request Classification - Using the retrieved ticket contents, the system classifies the intent behind the support request using your code. This classification helps identify the most appropriate team or service to handle the ticket. For the webhook-based approach to work, your code from the previous section will need to be served using a RESTful API which can be called from the webhook. The endpoint for the request would need to be reachable from the internet.\n",
      "Ticket Update - Finally, the ticket is updated back into the Support Ticket System, from where the assigned support team can work on resolving it.\n",
      "Note: While the classification method calls Claude API, we’ve removed that extra call from the diagram for simplicity.\n",

      "Prompting vs. finetuning Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency : Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.

      "Prompt engineering is far faster than other methods of model behavior control, such as finetuning, and can often yield leaps in performance in far less time. Here are some reasons to consider prompt engineering over finetuning: Resource efficiency : Fine-tuning requires high-end GPUs and large memory, while prompt engineering only needs text input, making it much more resource-friendly. Cost-effectiveness : For cloud-based AI services, fine-tuning incurs significant costs. Prompt engineering uses the base model, which is typically cheaper. Maintaining model updates : When providers update models, fine-tuned versions might need retraining. Prompts usually work across versions without changes. Time-saving : Fine-tuning can take hours or even days. In contrast, prompt engineering provides nearly instantaneous results, allowing for quick problem-solving. Minimal data needs : Fine-tuning needs substantial task-specific, labeled data, which can be scarce or expensive. Prompt engineering works with few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Flexibility & rapid iteration : Quickly try various approaches, tweak prompts, and see immediate results. This rapid experimentation is difficult with fine-tuning. Domain adaptation : Easily adapt models to new domains by providing domain-specific context in prompts, without retraining.

Higher temperatures lead to more creative and diverse outputs, allowing for multiple variations in phrasing and, in the case of fiction, variation in answers as well. Lower temperatures result in more conservative and deterministic outputs that stick to the most probable phrasing and answers. Adjusting the temperature enables users to encourage a language model to explore rare, uncommon, or surprising word choices and sequences, rather than only selecting the most likely predictions. Claude Slackbot uses a non-zero temperature when generating responses, which allows for some variation in its answers while maintaining coherence and relevance.\n",
