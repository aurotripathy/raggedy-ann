    "# RAG Retrieval Enhanced with Document Summaries\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We load the original document chunks.\n",
    "2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using OpenAI (or an OpenAI compatible API).\n",
    "3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries."

    "In this section, we implement the retrieval process using our new summary-enhanced vector database. This approach leverages the enhanced embeddings we created, which incorporate document summaries along with the original content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key aspects of this updated retrieval process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We search the vector database using the query embedding, retrieving the top k most similar documents.\n",
    "2. For each retrieved document, we include the chunk heading, summary, and full text in the context provided to the LLM.\n",
    "3. This enriched context is then used to generate an answer to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By including summaries in both the embedding and retrieval phases, we aim to provide the LLM with a more comprehensive and focused context. This could potentially lead to more accurate and relevant answers, as the LLM has access to both a concise overview (the summary) and the detailed information (the full text) for each relevant document chunk."

For example, you might use tags like `<task>`, `<subtask>`, and `<output>` to organize your prompts effectively.\n",
      "\n",

      "4. **Incorporate Chain of Thought**: Use tags like `<thinking>` and `<answer>` to encourage Claude to articulate its reasoning process. This helps in guiding Claude through the thought process required to arrive at a solution.\n",

      "5. **Iterate and Refine**: After receiving outputs from Claude, refine your prompts based on its performance. Adjust the structure or the clarity of your XML tags as needed to improve the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Maintain Consistency**: Use consistent tag names throughout your prompts. This consistency aids in clarity and helps Claude understand the structure of the information being presented.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Leverage Flexibility and Parseability**: The use of XML tags allows for easy modifications to your prompts without needing to rewrite everything. It also facilitates post-processing of Claude's responses, making it simpler to extract specific information.\n",

This can lead to improved customer satisfaction and more effective ticket handling.\n",

      "When Claude determines that one of the user-provided tools can help answer the user's query, it constructs a tool use request. This causes the API response to have a stop_reason of \"tool_use\", signaling Claude's intent to use the tool. The user must then extract the tool input from Claude's request, run the actual tool code client-side, and continue the conversation by sending the tool results back to Claude.\n",
      "__Generated answer__:\n",
      "The stop_reason of \"tool_use\" is a critical part of the workflow for integrating external tools with Claude. It indicates that Claude has determined a tool is necessary to address the user's query. This process unfolds in several steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Tool Provision and User Prompt**: Initially, the user provides Claude with the necessary tools and a prompt that may require those tools. This includes defining the tools with their names, descriptions, and input schemas.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Decision to Use a Tool**: When Claude receives the user prompt, it evaluates whether any of the provided tools can assist in answering the query. If it identifies a suitable tool, it constructs a tool use request.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Tool Use Request**: The API response from Claude will include a stop_reason of \"tool_use,\" which signifies that Claude intends to utilize a specific tool to fulfill the request. This response will also contain a tool_use content block that details the tool's name and the input parameters it will use.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Execution and Result Handling**: After receiving the tool use request, the user must execute the tool with the specified input. The results from this execution are then sent back to Claude in a structured format, allowing Claude to incorporate the tool's output into its final response to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Final Response Formulation**: Claude uses the results obtained from the tool to craft a comprehensive response to the original user prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the \"tool_use\" stop_reason is a signal of Claude's intent to engage with external tools, marking a pivotal moment in the workflow where the assistant transitions from generating responses based solely on its internal knowledge to leveraging external capabilities for enhanced accuracy and functionality.\n",
