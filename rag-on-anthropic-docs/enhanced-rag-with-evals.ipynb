    "# RAG Retrieval Enhanced with Document Summaries\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We load the original document chunks.\n",
    "2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using OpenAI (or an OpenAI compatible API).\n",
    "3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries."

      "To use Claude to more easily digest the content of long PDF documents, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Place Longform Data at the Top**: Start your prompt by including the long PDF content at the top. This helps Claude understand the context better. For documents that are around 20K+ tokens, ensure they are positioned before your query or instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Structure with XML Tags**: If you are working with multiple documents, wrap each document's content in XML tags. Use `<document>` tags for each document, and include `<document_content>` and `<source>` tags for clarity. This structured approach helps Claude to parse and understand the documents effectively.\n",

      "   </documents>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ground Responses in Quotes**: Ask Claude to extract and quote relevant parts of the documents first. This helps in filtering out unnecessary information and allows Claude to focus on the most pertinent content.\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "You can use an LLM like Claude to grade the outputs of other LLMs by providing it with the output to grade along with a detailed rubric. Instruct the LLM to think through its reasoning and then output a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect' result based on how well the output matches the criteria in the rubric.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "To use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define a Clear Rubric**: Create detailed and specific grading criteria. For example, specify that certain key phrases or concepts must be present in the answer for it to be considered correct. This rubric should outline what constitutes a correct or incorrect response.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Build a Grader Prompt**: Use a function to construct a prompt that instructs Claude to evaluate the answer based on the rubric. The prompt should include the rubric and the answer to be graded, and it should ask Claude to think through its reasoning before providing a final judgment. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def build_grader_prompt(answer, rubric):\n",
      "       return f\"\"\"Grade this answer based on the rubric:\n",
      "       <rubric>{rubric}</rubric>\n",
      "       <answer>{answer}</answer>\n",
      "       Think through your reasoning in <thinking> tags, then output 'correct' or 'incorrect' in <result> tags.\"\"\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Grade the Output**: Implement a function that sends the constructed prompt to Claude and retrieves the grading result. This function should check if the response contains \"correct\" or \"incorrect\" to determine the grade:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def grade_completion(output, golden_answer):\n",
      "       grader_response = client.messages.create(\n",

      "       return \"correct\" if \"correct\" in grader_response.lower() else \"incorrect\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evaluate Multiple Outputs**: Collect the outputs from the LLMs you want to grade and use the grading function to evaluate each one against the rubric. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   eval_data = [\n",
      "       {\"question\": \"Is 42 the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\", \"golden_answer\": \"Yes, according to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.\"},\n",
      "       {\"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\", \"golden_answer\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"}\n",
      "   ]\n",
      "\n",
      "   outputs = [get_completion(q[\"question\"]) for q in eval_data]\n",
      "   grades = [grade_completion(output, a[\"golden_answer\"]) for output, a in zip(outputs, eval_data)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculate and Report Scores**: Finally, calculate the percentage of correct grades and report the results. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   print(f\"Score: {grades.count('correct') / len(grades) * 100}%\")\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "Providing edge case examples to Claude in the prompt can meaningfully improve its performance in correctly routing support tickets in scenarios where it may otherwise misclassify them, such as implicit requests, emotional prioritization, ambiguous intent vs. routing, or issue prioritization.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "Providing Claude with examples of handling edge cases like implicit requests and emotional prioritization can significantly enhance its performance in routing support tickets. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implicit Requests**: Customers often communicate their needs indirectly. For instance, a statement like “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now” implies a request for order status. By training Claude with examples of such implicit requests, it can learn to recognize and appropriately classify these indirect inquiries, ensuring that tickets are routed to the right team without requiring explicit requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotional Prioritization**: Customers may express dissatisfaction or frustration, which can be critical to address. If Claude is equipped with guidelines on when to prioritize emotional responses over technical solutions, it can better handle situations where customer sentiment is paramount. This means that tickets from upset customers might be routed more urgently to ensure their concerns are addressed promptly, improving overall customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intent vs. Routing**: Sometimes, Claude may identify a customer’s intent correctly but route the ticket incorrectly. Providing examples that clarify the appropriate routing for certain intents can help Claude make more accurate decisions, especially in ambiguous cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Issue Prioritization**: Customers may present multiple issues in a single interaction. By clarifying how to prioritize these issues, Claude can be trained to identify the primary concern more effectively, ensuring that the most pressing matters are addressed first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, incorporating these edge case examples into Claude's training allows for a more nuanced understanding of customer interactions, leading to improved accuracy in ticket classification and routing.

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "When Claude determines that one of the user-provided tools can help answer the user's query, it constructs a tool use request. This causes the API response to have a stop_reason of \"tool_use\", signaling Claude's intent to use the tool. The user must then extract the tool input from Claude's request, run the actual tool code client-side, and continue the conversation by sending the tool results back to Claude.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "The stop_reason of \"tool_use\" indicates that Claude has determined that using an external tool is necessary to address the user's query effectively. This is a critical part of the workflow for integrating external tools with Claude, as it signifies Claude's intent to leverage additional capabilities beyond its built-in knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the overall workflow, the process begins with the user providing Claude with tools and a prompt. Claude then assesses whether any of the provided tools can assist with the query. If it identifies a suitable tool, it constructs a tool use request, which results in an API response containing the stop_reason of \"tool_use.\" This response includes details about the tool being used, such as its name and the input parameters required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Subsequently, the user must extract the tool input from Claude's request and execute the tool code on their end. Once the tool has been executed, the results are sent back to Claude, which then uses this information to formulate a final response to the user's original prompt. This integration allows for a seamless interaction where Claude can enhance its responses by utilizing external tools, thereby improving the overall user experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the \"tool_use\" stop_reason is a pivotal marker in the workflow that indicates the transition from Claude's internal processing to the utilization of external tools, facilitating a more comprehensive and accurate response to user queries.\n",

      "1. **Text Content Blocks**: The delta format for text content blocks is straightforward and focuses on text changes. It uses a structure that includes a `type` indicating it is a `text_delta`, along with the updated text. For example, a text delta might look like this:\n",
      "   ```json\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Tool_Use Content Blocks**: In contrast, the delta format for tool_use content blocks deals with updates to input fields and uses partial JSON strings to represent changes. The final output is always an object, but during streaming, the updates are provided as partial JSON strings. For example, a tool_use content block delta might look like this:\n",
      "   ```json\n",
      "   {\n",
      "       \"type\": \"content_block_delta\",\n",
      "       \"index\": 1,\n",
