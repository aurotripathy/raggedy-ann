    "How to run Llama 3.1 in the cloud hosted on Replicate\n",
    "How to use LangChain to ask Llama general questions and follow up questions\n",
    "How to use LangChain to load a recent web page - Hugging Face's blog post on Llama 3.1 - and chat about it. This is the well known RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) method to let LLM such as Llama 3 be able to answer questions about the data not publicly available when Llama 3 was trained, or about your own data. RAG is one way to prevent LLM's hallucination\n",
    "Note We will be using Replicate to run the examples here. You will need to first sign in with Replicate with your github account, then create a free API token here that you can use for a while. You can also use other Llama 3.1 cloud providers such as Groq, Together, or Anyscale - see Section 2 of the Getting to Know Llama notebook for more information.\n",
