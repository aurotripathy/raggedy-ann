    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation (Basic w/Evals)\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs excels at a wide range of tasks, but struggle with queries specific to your unique business context. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes invaluable. RAG enables the LLM to leverage your internal knowledge bases or customer support documents, significantly enhancing its ability to answer domain-specific questions. Enterprises are increasingly building RAG applications to improve workflows in customer support, Q&A over internal company documents, financial & legal analysis, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build and optimize a RAG system using the Anthropic documentation as our knowledge base. We'll walk you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embeddings are from the `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct` model, where input is truncated to at most 512 tokens\n",
    "2. In-memory vector database class is from Anthropic\n",
    "3. Building a robust evaluation suite. We'll go beyond 'vibes' based evals and show you how to measure the retrieval pipeine & end to end performance independently\n",
    "4. Implementing advanced techniques to improve RAG including summary indexing and re-ranking with Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of targeted improvements, we achieved significant performance gains on the following metrics compared to a basic RAG pipeline (we'll explain what all these metrics *mean* in a bit)\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "You can use an LLM like Claude to grade the outputs of other LLMs by providing it with the output to grade along with a detailed rubric. Instruct the LLM to think through its reasoning and then output a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect' result based on how well the output matches the criteria in the rubric.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "To use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define a Clear Rubric**: Create a detailed rubric that specifies the criteria for grading. For example, you might state that \"the answer should always mention 'Acme Inc.' in the first sentence.\" This clarity helps the LLM understand what to look for in the responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Build a Grader Prompt**: Construct a prompt that instructs Claude to evaluate an answer based on the rubric. The prompt should include the rubric and the answer to be graded. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def build_grader_prompt(answer, rubric):\n",
      "       return f\"\"\"Grade this answer based on the rubric:\n",
      "       <rubric>{rubric}</rubric>\n",

      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Grade the Output**: Use the defined rubric and the answer generated by the other LLM to get a grading response from Claude. This can be done by sending the constructed prompt to Claude and interpreting the response:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def grade_completion(output, golden_answer):\n",
      "       grader_response = client.messages.create(\n",

      "\n",
      "       return \"correct\" if \"correct\" in grader_response.lower() else \"incorrect\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evaluate Multiple Outputs**: For a set of questions and their corresponding golden answers, generate outputs using the other LLM and then grade them using the grading function. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   eval_data = [\n",
      "       {\"question\": \"Is 42 the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\", \"golden_answer\": \"Yes, according to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.\"},\n",
      "       {\"question\": \"What is the capital of France?\", \"golden_answer\": \"The capital of France is Paris.\"}\n",
      "   ]\n",
      "\n",
      "   outputs = [get_completion(q[\"question\"]) for q in eval_data]\n",
      "   grades = [grade_completion(output, a[\"golden_answer\"]) for output, a in zip(outputs, eval_data)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculate Scores**: Finally, calculate the percentage of correct grades to assess the overall performance:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   print(f\"Score: {grades.count('correct') / len(grades) * 100}%\")\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",

      "How can providing Claude with examples of handling certain edge cases like implicit requests or emotional prioritization help improve its performance in routing support tickets?\n",
      "Correct answer:\n",
      "Providing edge case examples to Claude in the prompt can meaningfully improve its performance in correctly routing support tickets in scenarios where it may otherwise misclassify them, such as implicit requests, emotional prioritization, ambiguous intent vs. routing, or issue prioritization.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "Providing Claude with examples of handling edge cases like implicit requests and emotional prioritization can significantly enhance its performance in routing support tickets by improving its understanding of nuanced customer interactions. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implicit Requests**: Customers often communicate their needs indirectly. By training Claude with examples of such implicit requests, it can learn to recognize phrases that suggest a need for information or action, even when not explicitly stated. For instance, a statement like “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now” should trigger a routing to the order status team, rather than being misclassified as a general inquiry. This helps ensure that tickets are routed to the appropriate department without requiring customers to explicitly state their requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotional Prioritization**: Customers frequently express emotions such as frustration or disappointment. By providing Claude with guidelines on when to prioritize addressing these emotions versus focusing on the technical resolution of the issue, it can better assess the urgency and nature of the ticket. For example, a customer expressing dissatisfaction may need immediate emotional acknowledgment before their issue is resolved, which can lead to better customer satisfaction and more effective ticket handling.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intent vs. Routing**: Claude may identify a customer’s intent correctly but still route the ticket incorrectly. By clarifying the appropriate routes for various intents, especially those that are ambiguous, Claude can improve its accuracy in directing tickets to the right teams. This reduces the chances of misrouting and ensures that tickets are handled by the most qualified personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Issue Prioritization**: When customers present multiple issues in a single interaction, it can be challenging for Claude to determine which issue is the primary concern. By providing examples that clarify how to prioritize these issues, Claude can be trained to identify the most pressing concern and route the ticket accordingly. This leads to more efficient handling of customer inquiries and a better overall experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, by incorporating specific examples of edge cases into Claude's training, organizations can enhance its ability to accurately interpret and route support tickets, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction. Regularly reviewing and refining these examples will further optimize Claude's performance as the system evolves.\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "When Claude determines that one of the user-provided tools can help answer the user's query, it constructs a tool use request. This causes the API response to have a stop_reason of \"tool_use\", signaling Claude's intent to use the tool.

      "   - The deltas for tool_use content blocks are designed to update the input field of the block. They consist of partial JSON strings that represent incremental updates to the input data.\n",

      "To evaluate a model's performance on a ticket routing classifier, you should consider the following factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accuracy**: Measure how well the model correctly classifies tickets into the appropriate categories or teams. This can be done using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy. A confusion matrix can also help visualize the model's performance across different classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cost**: Assess the operational costs associated with using the model, including computational resources, infrastructure, and any potential costs related to errors (e.g., misrouted tickets leading to delays or customer dissatisfaction). It's important to balance the model's performance with its cost-effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Speed**: Evaluate the response time of the model in classifying tickets. This is crucial for ensuring that the ticket routing process is efficient and does not introduce delays in handling customer inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, understanding the existing ticketing system and how tickets are currently routed can provide valuable context for evaluating the model. Investigate the criteria used for routing, existing automated rules, and how edge cases are managed. This knowledge will help you assess the model's performance against real-world scenarios and expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing the right model is also important; for instance, the claude-3-haiku-20240307 model is noted for being fast and cost-effective, while a more complex model like Sonnet may be necessary for intricate classification tasks.\n",
