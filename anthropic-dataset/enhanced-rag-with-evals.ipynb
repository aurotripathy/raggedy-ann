    "# RAG Retrieval Enhanced with Document Summaries\n",
    "In this section, we'll implement an improved approach to our retrieval system by incorporating document summaries. Instead of embedding chunks directly from the documents, we'll create a concise summary for each chunk and use this summary along with the original content in our embedding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aims to capture the essence of each document chunk more effectively, potentially leading to improved retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key steps in this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We load the original document chunks.\n",
    "2. For each chunk, we generate a 2-3 sentence summary using OpenAI (or an OpenAI compatible API).\n",
    "3. We store both the original content and the summary for each chunk in a new json file: data/anthropic_summary_indexed_docs.json\n",
    "\n",
    "This summary-enhanced approach is designed to provide more context during the embedding and retrieval phases, potentially improving the system's ability to understand and match the most relevant documents to user queries."

    "\n",
    "1. We search the vector database using the query embedding, retrieving the top k most similar documents.\n",

This could potentially lead to more accurate and relevant answers, as the LLM has access to both a concise overview (the summary) and the detailed information (the full text) for each relevant document chunk."

      "3. **Consistency**: Assesses whether the model produces similar outputs for similar inputs, indicating reliability in its predictions.\n",

Smaller models like Claude 3 Haiku are typically preferred for their efficiency and faster response times, making them suitable for real-time applications. However, if the classification task requires more complex reasoning or specialized knowledge, a larger model like Sonnet may be necessary, albeit at the cost of increased latency and potentially higher expenses.

      "To use Claude for digesting long PDF documents more effectively, follow these strategies:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Place Longform Data at the Top**: Start your prompt with the content of the PDF document. This helps Claude understand the context better. For documents that are around 20,000 tokens or more, ensure this content is positioned above your specific queries or instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Structure Content with XML Tags**: If you are working with multiple documents, organize them using XML tags. For example, wrap each document in `<document>` tags, and include `<document_content>` and `<source>` tags for clarity. This structured approach helps Claude parse the information more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example structure:\n",
      "   ```xml\n",
      "   <documents>\n",
      "     <document index=\"1\">\n",
      "       <source>document1.pdf</source>\n",

      "     </document>\n",
      "   </documents>\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ground Responses in Quotes**: Ask Claude to extract and quote relevant sections from the document before addressing your specific questions. This technique allows Claude to focus on the most pertinent information and reduces the noise from the rest of the document.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example request:\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   Find quotes from the document that are relevant to [your specific question]. Then, based on these quotes, provide a summary or analysis.\n",
      "   ```\n",

      "Quantitative metrics that can be used to measure the success of a sentiment analysis model include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model, calculated as (Number of correct predictions) / (Total number of predictions).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **F1 Score**: A measure that balances precision and recall, providing a single score that reflects both the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances and its ability to avoid false positives.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives, indicating how many of the predicted positive sentiments were actually correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives, showing how many of the actual positive sentiments were correctly identified by the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consistency**: Evaluates whether the model's outputs are stable and logical across similar inputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Speed**: Measures the response time of the model, ensuring it operates within acceptable latency thresholds for the task.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Bias and Fairness**: Assesses whether the model demonstrates any biases in its predictions based on sensitive attributes like gender or ethnicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Targets for these metrics can be determined based on:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Industry Benchmarks**: Researching what performance levels are standard in the field for similar models.\n",
      "- **Prior Experiments**: Analyzing results from previous versions of the model or similar tasks to set realistic improvement goals.\n",
      "- **Expert Knowledge**: Consulting with domain experts to establish what constitutes acceptable performance for the specific application.\n",
      "- **User Needs**: Aligning targets with the expectations and requirements of the end-users of the sentiment analysis model.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, a specific target might be to achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85 on a held-out test set of diverse Twitter posts, representing a 5% improvement over the current baseline. This target is measurable, specific, relevant to the application, and achievable based on prior performance data.\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "You can use an LLM like Claude to grade the outputs of other LLMs by providing it with the output to grade along with a detailed rubric. Instruct the LLM to think through its reasoning and then output a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect' result based on how well the output matches the criteria in the rubric.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "To use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric, follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Establish a Clear Rubric**: Create a detailed and clear rubric that outlines the criteria for grading. For example, specify that certain key phrases or concepts must be included in the answer. This rubric should be empirical and specific, allowing for straightforward evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Build a Grader Prompt**: Construct a prompt for Claude that instructs it to evaluate the answer based on the rubric. The prompt should include the rubric and the answer to be graded. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def build_grader_prompt(answer, rubric):\n",
      "       return f\"\"\"Grade this answer based on the rubric:\n",
      "       <rubric>{rubric}</rubric>\n",
      "       <answer>{answer}</answer>\n",
      "       Think through your reasoning in <thinking> tags, then output 'correct' or 'incorrect' in <result> tags.\"\"\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implement Grading Logic**: Use the prompt to send the answer and rubric to Claude and receive a grading response. The grading function should check Claude's output to determine if the answer meets the criteria set in the rubric. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   def grade_completion(output, golden_answer):\n",
      "       grader_response = client.messages.create(\n",
      "           model=\"claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n",
      "           max_tokens=2048,\n",
      "           messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": build_grader_prompt(output, golden_answer)}]\n",
      "       ).content[0].text\n",
      "\n",
      "       return \"correct\" if \"correct\" in grader_response.lower() else \"incorrect\"\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Evaluate Outputs**: Collect the outputs from the LLMs you want to grade and use the grading function to assess each output against the rubric. For example:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   outputs = [get_completion(q[\"question\"]) for q in eval_data]\n",
      "   grades = [grade_completion(output, a[\"golden_answer\"]) for output, a in zip(outputs, eval_data)]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Calculate Scores**: Finally, calculate the overall score based on the grading results. For instance:\n",
      "   ```python\n",
      "   print(f\"Score: {grades.count('correct') / len(grades) * 100}%\")\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",

      "Generated anser:\n",
      "The relationship between Time to First Token (TTFT) and latency is that TTFT is a specific metric used to measure a component of latency.

      "Latency, in a broader sense, refers to the overall time taken for the model to respond to a prompt, which includes the time taken to process the prompt and generate the entire response.

      "How can providing Claude with examples of handling certain edge cases like implicit requests or emotional prioritization help improve its performance in routing support tickets?\n",
      "Correct answer:\n",
      "Providing edge case examples to Claude in the prompt can meaningfully improve its performance in correctly routing support tickets in scenarios where it may otherwise misclassify them, such as implicit requests, emotional prioritization, ambiguous intent vs. routing, or issue prioritization.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "Providing Claude with examples of handling edge cases like implicit requests and emotional prioritization can significantly enhance its performance in routing support tickets. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Implicit Requests**: Customers often communicate their needs indirectly. For instance, a statement like “I’ve been waiting for my package for over two weeks now” implies a request for order status. By training Claude with examples of such implicit requests, it can learn to recognize and correctly classify these indirect inquiries, ensuring that tickets are routed to the appropriate team without requiring explicit requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Emotional Prioritization**: Customers may express dissatisfaction or frustration, which can be critical to address. If Claude is trained to recognize when to prioritize customer sentiment over the technical aspects of the issue, it can better handle situations where emotional context is important. This helps in routing tickets to teams that are equipped to manage sensitive customer interactions, improving overall customer satisfaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Intent vs. Routing**: Sometimes, Claude may identify a customer’s intent accurately but still route the ticket incorrectly. Providing clear examples of how to differentiate between various intents and their corresponding routes can help Claude improve its classification accuracy, ensuring that tickets reach the right department.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Issue Prioritization**: When customers present multiple issues in a single ticket, it can be challenging for Claude to determine which issue to prioritize. By clarifying how to identify and prioritize the primary concern among multiple issues, Claude can enhance its ability to route tickets effectively, leading to quicker resolutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, incorporating these edge case examples into Claude's training will refine its understanding of nuanced customer interactions, leading to more accurate ticket classification and improved routing efficiency.

This causes the API response to have a stop_reason of \"tool_use\", signaling Claude's intent to use the tool.

      "2. **Tool_Use Content Blocks**: In contrast, the delta for tool_use content blocks involves partial JSON strings that represent updates to the input field of the block.

      "   ```json\n",
