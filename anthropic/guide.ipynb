    "# Retrieval Augmented Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs excels at a wide range of tasks, but struggle with queries specific to your unique business context. This is where Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) becomes invaluable. RAG enables the LLM to leverage your internal knowledge bases or customer support documents, significantly enhancing its ability to answer domain-specific questions. Enterprises are increasingly building RAG applications to improve workflows in customer support, Q&A over internal company documents, financial & legal analysis, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to build and optimize a RAG system using the Anthropic documentation as our knowledge base. We'll walk you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embeddings are from the `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large-instruct` model, where input is truncated to at most 512 tokens\n",
    "2. In-memory vector database class is from Anthropic\n",
    "3. Building a robust evaluation suite. We'll go beyond 'vibes' based evals and show you how to measure the retrieval pipeine & end to end performance independently\n",
    "4. Implementing advanced techniques to improve RAG including summary indexing and re-ranking with Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a series of targeted improvements, we achieved significant performance gains on the following metrics compared to a basic RAG pipeline (we'll explain what all these metrics *mean* in a bit)\n",

      "When evaluating Claude's performance on a classification task, some key success metrics to consider include accuracy, F1 score, consistency, structure, speed, bias and fairness. Choosing the right model that fits your specific requirements in terms of speed and output quality is a straightforward way to reduce latency and meet the acceptable response time for your use case.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "When evaluating Claude's performance on a classification task, several key success metrics should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accuracy**: This is the most straightforward metric, representing the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances. While useful, it can be misleading in cases of class imbalance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Precision**: This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made. High precision indicates that the model has a low false positive rate, which is crucial in applications where false positives are costly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. High recall is important in scenarios where missing a positive instance is critical, such as in medical diagnoses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **F1 Score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it takes both false positives and false negatives into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **ROC-AUC**: The Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve metric evaluates the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different thresholds. A higher AUC indicates better model performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Latency**: This refers to the time taken by the model to make predictions. In real-time applications, low latency is crucial for user experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "When choosing the right model to reduce latency, it is essential to balance performance metrics with the computational efficiency of the model. For instance, simpler models (like logistic regression or decision trees) may offer lower latency compared to more complex models (like deep neural networks) while still achieving acceptable accuracy. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while evaluating Claude's performance, it is important to consider a combination of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, while also keeping latency in mind to ensure that the model is not only accurate but also efficient for practical use.\n",

It can handle mid-response prompts by maintaining the context of the conversation, enabling it to respond to user inputs that may occur at any point during the response generation.

      "You can use an LLM like Claude to grade the outputs of other LLMs by providing it with the output to grade along with a detailed rubric. Instruct the LLM to think through its reasoning and then output a simple 'correct' or 'incorrect' result based on how well the output matches the criteria in the rubric.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "To use an LLM like Claude to automatically grade the outputs of other LLMs based on a rubric, you can follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define the Grading Rubric**: Clearly outline the criteria and standards for evaluation. This rubric should include specific aspects such as content accuracy, coherence, creativity, grammar, and adherence to the prompt.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Input the Outputs**: Collect the outputs generated by the other LLMs that you want to evaluate. These outputs will be the text that Claude will assess.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Prompt Design**: Create a structured prompt for Claude that includes the rubric and the outputs to be graded. For example, you can format the prompt to say: \"Please evaluate the following output based on the rubric provided: [insert rubric here]. Output: [insert LLM output here].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Automated Grading**: Submit the prompt to Claude. The LLM will analyze the output according to the rubric and provide a score or qualitative feedback based on the defined criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Iterate and Refine**: Depending on the results, you may need to refine the rubric or the prompts to ensure that the grading aligns with your expectations. You can also conduct a validation phase where you compare Claude's grading with human grading to assess reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Aggregate Results**: If grading multiple outputs, you can aggregate the scores or feedback to provide an overall assessment of the performance of the other LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these steps, you can leverage Claude's capabilities to automate the grading process effectively.\n",

      "Generated anser:\n",
      "Providing Claude with examples of handling edge cases like implicit requests or emotional prioritization can significantly enhance its performance in routing support tickets in several ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Understanding Context**: By training Claude on examples of implicit requests, it can learn to recognize when a customer is hinting at a need without explicitly stating it. This understanding allows for more accurate ticket categorization and prioritization, ensuring that urgent or nuanced issues are addressed promptly.\n",

      "How does the stop_reason of \"tool_use\" relate to the overall workflow of integrating external tools with Claude?\n",
      "Correct answer:\n",
      "When Claude determines that one of the user-provided tools can help answer the user's query, it constructs a tool use request. This causes the API response to have a stop_reason of \"tool_use\", signaling Claude's intent to use the tool. The user must then extract the tool input from Claude's request, run the actual tool code client-side, and continue the conversation by sending the tool results back to Claude.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "The stop_reason of \"tool_use\" indicates that the workflow involving Claude has reached a point where external tools are being utilized. This is significant in the context of integrating external tools with Claude, as it suggests that the system is designed to pause or halt its current processing to allow for the execution of tasks that require these tools. \n",
      "\n",
      "In an integrated workflow, \"tool_use\" can serve as a trigger for specific actions or processes that enhance Claude's capabilities. For instance, when a task requires data processing, analysis, or any function that is beyond Claude's inherent capabilities, the system can invoke external tools. The integration of these tools is crucial for expanding the functionality of Claude, allowing it to perform a wider range of tasks effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the \"tool_use\" stop_reason is a critical component of the overall workflow, as it signifies the interaction between Claude and external resources, ensuring that the system can leverage additional functionalities as needed to complete tasks efficiently. This integration ultimately enhances the user experience by providing more comprehensive solutions through the combined capabilities of Claude and the external tools.\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "The two main approaches for integrating Claude into a support ticket workflow are push-based using webhooks, and pull-based. The push-based approach is more web-scalable but requires exposing a public endpoint which has IT security implications. The pull-based approach is easier to implement but makes unnecessary calls to the support ticket system.\n",
      "Generated anser:\n",
      "The two main approaches for integrating Claude into a support ticket workflow are:\n",

      "1. **API Integration**: This approach involves using Claude's API to directly connect it with the support ticket system. The API can be used to send and receive data, allowing Claude to process tickets, generate responses, and interact with users in real-time. \n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Scalability**: API integration is highly scalable as it can handle a large volume of requests simultaneously. It allows for easy expansion of capabilities by adding more endpoints or features as needed.\n",
      "   - **Ease of Implementation**: This approach may require more technical expertise to set up and maintain, as it involves programming and understanding both the API and the existing ticketing system.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Pre-built Integration Tools**: This approach utilizes existing platforms or tools that offer built-in integration with Claude. These tools often provide user-friendly interfaces and require minimal coding, allowing businesses to set up the integration quickly.\n",

      "   - **Scalability**: While pre-built tools can be scalable, they may have limitations based on the tool's architecture and the number of users or tickets it can handle effectively.\n",

      "Correct answer:\n",
      "Compared to fine-tuning, prompt engineering is far more effective at helping models understand and utilize external content like retrieved documents. Prompt engineering also preserves the model's broad general knowledge, while fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting where the model loses its general capabilities.\n",

      "Two key advantages of prompt engineering over fine-tuning in terms of model comprehension and general knowledge preservation are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preservation of General Knowledge**: Prompt engineering allows the model to leverage its pre-existing knowledge without altering its weights or training data. This means that the model retains its broad understanding and general knowledge, which can be crucial for tasks requiring a wide-ranging context. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, can lead to overfitting on specific datasets, potentially causing the model to lose some of its general knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Prompt engineering provides a flexible approach to task specification, allowing users to craft prompts that can adapt to various contexts and requirements without the need for retraining the model. This adaptability makes it easier to explore different tasks and domains while maintaining the model's original capabilities. Fine-tuning typically involves a more rigid adjustment to the model, which may not be as easily transferable to new tasks or contexts.\n",
